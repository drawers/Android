# Automated migrations using lint and LM

This is a fork of the DuckDuckGo Android project. We chose this project to experiment on for two reasons:
1. It's public so we don't have to worry about jeopardizing intellectual property
2. It's representative of a large Android project
3. It already has integration with lint, so this makes it easier to try out new things.
